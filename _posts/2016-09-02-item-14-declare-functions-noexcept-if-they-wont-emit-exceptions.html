<p>C++98 exception specification is not very worthwhile. A change to the spec will easily break client codes. During work on C++11, it is decided that a true exception spec should only care about whether a function should throw or not, that's how noexcept came out.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>noexcept is part of function interface, by default it is false,i.e. the function may throw</h3>
</blockquote>
<h3></h3>
<blockquote>
<h3>compiler provides more optimization for noexcept function than non-noexcept function.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>[code language="cpp"]<br />
void foo() throw();  // c++ 98 no throw style<br />
void bar() noexcept; // c++ 11 no throw style<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>In the above code, if foo (i.e. C++ 98 style no throw) violates exception specification and throws, the call stack is unwounded to foo's caller, and terminated. This is guaranteed by spec. But if bar violates exception specification, there's no such guarantee,i.e. runtime will terminate without unwinding call stack to foo's caller.  This difference allows c++ 11's compiler optimizer to avoid having to maintain the call stack in a unwindable state. In contrast, C++ 98's optimizer doesn't have have this optimization flexibility, resulting in more optimized codes in C++11's noexcept function</p>
<p>[code language="cpp"]<br />
void foo() throw(); // less optimizable<br />
void foo(); // default is may throw, thus less optimizable<br />
void foo() noexcept; // most optimizable<br />
[/code]</p>

<h3>Most function are exception neutral, meaning that they won't emit exceptions themselves, but the function they invoke might. These functions are not noexcept</h3>
