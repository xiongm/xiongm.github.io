<h3 class="p1">Compared to direct use of <span class="s1">new</span>, <span class="s1">make </span>functions eliminate source code duplication,provides cleaner, concise codes, improve exception safety, and, for <span class="s1">std::make_shared </span>and <span class="s1">std::allo</span><span class="s1">cate_shared</span>, generate code that’s smaller and faster.</h3>

<ul>
<li>exception safety - by merging two steps (object creation followed by shared_ptr creation) into one, eliminates potential memory leak</li>
<li>faster code - by making one memory allocation requests to system</li>
</ul>
